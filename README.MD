API Key
To use the Google Places Autocomplete and Maps Directions APIs, you will need an API key. You can get it from the Google Cloud Console

Once you have the API key, replace the following placeholder with your actual API key in your code:

// Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your Google API key
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
Please make sure to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual API key as mentioned above. This will allow your app to access the Google services.

You can copy and paste this content into your markdown file, and it should be free of errors. Remember to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual API key in your code before running the application.
